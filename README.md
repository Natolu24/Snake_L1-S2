# Snake_L1-S2

Was a dumb idea project from the "teacher" making a game (snake in my case) WITHOUT using nodes on Godot, so only writing codes to make everything...
So without very much understanding the dumb reason why we can't use nodes, we made a solid and plain snake game, and that's about it. (Except the Node2D from start, nodes weren't use as told)
